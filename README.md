This repository contains my first python project. 
In this project I try to simulate a chess game as accurately as possible, by creating the ChessGame() class in python. 
The idea is simple, create the ChessGame() class, and within, a move() method, which takes only a 'piece_type' and 'destination' input. Now the challenge is to make sure that 
no pieces can be moved to alternate dimensions, no ostriches can take part in the game, and when played, checkmate will end it.
I am new to git and github and picked up coding as a hobbyist. Most likely noone is going to read this, but if you do, feel free to check out my code and leave advice when somehting disgustes you.
